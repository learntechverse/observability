## Observability vs. Application Performance Management (APM)

### Observability

**Observability** is like being able to look at a car and, just by listening to the sounds it makes, watching how it drives, and seeing the warning lights on the dashboard, figure out if something is wrong and what might be causing it. It’s about understanding the car's internal workings based on the clues it gives you.

### Application Performance Management (APM)

**Application Performance Management (APM)** is like having a dashboard in your car that shows you specific information, such as your speed, fuel level, and engine temperature. It helps you monitor these specific aspects to ensure the car is running smoothly. If a problem arises, the dashboard helps you identify which part needs attention.

### Comparing the Two

- **APM**: Focuses on monitoring and managing the performance of applications. It’s like having gauges that tell you specific things about your car's health, such as how fast you're going or if the engine is overheating.

- **Observability**: Provides a broader and deeper view. It's like being able to understand the entire car’s state and behavior based on all the sounds, lights, and movements, even if a new, unexpected problem arises. It helps you figure out why something is happening, not just what is happening.

## Observability vs. Application Performance Management (APM) Comparison

| Aspect                  | Observability                                                                                       | Application Performance Management (APM)                                            |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | Understanding and monitoring the internal state of a system based on its external outputs           | Monitoring and managing the performance of applications through specific metrics    |
| **Focus**               | Comprehensive understanding of system behavior and internal states                                  | Specific aspects of application performance                                         |
| **Approach**            | Uses metrics, logs, and traces to provide a holistic view                                           | Uses predefined metrics and dashboards to monitor performance (KPI's - Key Performance Indicator)                      |
| **Problem Diagnosis**   | Helps understand why something is happening by analyzing detailed data from various system parts    | Identifies what is happening and which part needs attention                         |
| **Flexibility**         | Capable of diagnosing new, unexpected problems                                                      | Best for tracking known performance metrics                                         |
| **Data Sources**        | Aggregates data from multiple sources (metrics, logs, traces)                                       | Relies mainly on predefined performance metrics                                     |
| **Use Case Example**    | Understanding why a website is slow by examining detailed traces and logs                           | Monitoring the website's response time and alerting if it gets too slow              |
| **Depth of Insight**    | Deep insights into system behavior, including root cause analysis                                   | Specific insights into application performance metrics                              |
| **Implementation**      | Often requires setting up multiple data collection and analysis tools                               | Typically involves setting up performance monitoring tools and dashboards           |


### Simple Example

Imagine you have a website:

- **APM** would tell you if the website is slow (like the speedometer in your car telling you how fast you're going).
- **Observability** would help you understand why the website is slow by giving you detailed information from different parts of the system (like understanding that the car is slow because the engine is making a strange noise, the fuel gauge is low, and the tires are underinflated).

In nutshell, APM gives you specific, useful insights to keep things running smoothly, while Observability gives you a comprehensive understanding to diagnose and fix any issues, especially the unexpected ones.
